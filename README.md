## 📂 Project Structure

I've kept things modular. Instead of shoving everything into `App.js`, each problem lives in its own component:

```text
src/
├── components/
│   ├── UserDirectory.jsx        # Problem 1: Search Logic
│   ├── CharacterCounter.jsx     # Problem 2: Input Limits
│   ├── TemperatureConverter.jsx # Problem 3: State Syncing
│   └── FocusTracker.jsx         # Problem 4: useRef Magic
├── App.jsx                      # Navigation to switch between problems
└── ...
